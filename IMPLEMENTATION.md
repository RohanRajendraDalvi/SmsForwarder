## Key Files Created

1. **App.js** - Main application component (280+ lines)
   - Email management logic
   - SMS listening functionality
   - UI components and styling

2. **package.json** - Project configuration
   - All necessary dependencies
   - Scripts for running, testing, and linting

3. **__tests__/App.test.js** - Test suite
   - Comprehensive tests for core functionality

4. **Android Configuration**
   - AndroidManifest.xml with required permissions
   - build.gradle configuration

5. **Supporting Files**
   - index.js (app entry point)
   - app.json (app configuration)
   - babel.config.js (Babel configuration)
   - metro.config.js (Metro bundler configuration)
   - .eslintrc.js (ESLint configuration)
   - .gitignore (Git ignore rules)

## How It Works

1. User opens the app
2. App requests SMS permissions
3. User adds email addresses using the input field
4. Emails are validated and stored locally
5. When an SMS is received, the app detects it
6. SMS details would be forwarded to all listed emails
7. User can delete emails at any time
8. All data persists across app restarts

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

- Implement actual email sending functionality (SMTP integration)
- Add email service configuration (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- Implement filtering options (specific senders, keywords)
- Add SMS history view
- Implement notification system
- Add settings for customization
